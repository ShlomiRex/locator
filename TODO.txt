* When grep is finished read everything.
* Each line -> Add to SearchWindow
* When it is successful, we can go to use pipes (while searching we get results, instead of waiting for complete search - read below)


When I have done that, continue with:
* When searching, output each line to a pipe. (no stdout)
* While searching, read the pipe, line by line. 
* Each line will represent a single result of grep, so for each line, add it to SearchWindow.

To impliment
=========

* Recursive search checkbox - didn't implimented
* Follow symbolic links checkbox - didn't implimented

In the future
=========

* Add 'search for installed packages' for newbies to linux finding spesific libraries.
* Checkboxes for 'Match case' / 'Case match'
