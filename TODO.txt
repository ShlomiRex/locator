====================================
The day before...
====================================
* I need to seperate the Main Window and Search Window to 2 threads.
* After that, I need to start another thread for reading the output of search thread. (Already implimented)
* This thread will also affect the Search Window Thread by changing the GUI.
* Overall we have:
    * Main Thread (Which is also handling the Main Window) - 1 -
    * Searcher Thread - 2 - located at SearchWindow.py - it will read from grep and the result is changing the GUI (which is in another thread - read next line)
    * Search Window Thread - 3- it's sole purpose is to handle GUI for Search Window.
* Firstly I need to test thread 1 and 2 only. Later we can add thread 3.
* I need to find a way so that thread 2 can change the GUI of thread 3.


====================================
Bugs
====================================
* When finished searching, and closing both windows, the process is still running in the background.

====================================
To impliment
====================================
* Instead of GtkWindow for SearchWindow, use GtkScrolledWindow (Also checkout GtkVBox - it may be useful)
* Recursive search checkbox - didn't implimented
* Follow symbolic links checkbox - didn't implimented
* Fix 'Maximum GUI Elements' in SearchWindow.py (Maximum allowed elements in list)

====================================
In the future
====================================
* Add 'search for installed packages' for newbies to linux finding spesific libraries.
* Checkboxes for 'Match case' / 'Case match'

====================================
Personal Comments
====================================
* When grep is finished read everything.
* Each line -> Add to SearchWindow
* When it is successful, we can go to use pipes (while searching we get results, instead of waiting for complete search - read below)


When I have done that, continue with:
* When searching, output each line to a pipe. (no stdout)
* While searching, read the pipe, line by line. 
* Each line will represent a single result of grep, so for each line, add it to SearchWindow.
