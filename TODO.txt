====================================
Bugs
====================================
* When finished searching, and closing both windows, the process is still running in the background.
* When closing the GTK window, the threads are still running for that search window. Solution: onDestroy - gracefuly destroy thread

====================================
To impliment
====================================
* Instead of GtkWindow for SearchWindow, use GtkScrolledWindow (Also checkout GtkVBox - it may be useful)
* Recursive search checkbox - didn't implimented
* Follow symbolic links checkbox - didn't implimented
* Fix 'Maximum GUI Elements' in SearchWindow.py (Maximum allowed elements in list)

====================================
In the future
====================================
* Add 'search for installed packages' for newbies to linux finding spesific libraries.
* Checkboxes for 'Match case' / 'Case match'

====================================
Personal Comments
====================================
* When grep is finished read everything.
* Each line -> Add to SearchWindow
* When it is successful, we can go to use pipes (while searching we get results, instead of waiting for complete search - read below)


When I have done that, continue with:
* When searching, output each line to a pipe. (no stdout)
* While searching, read the pipe, line by line. 
* Each line will represent a single result of grep, so for each line, add it to SearchWindow.
